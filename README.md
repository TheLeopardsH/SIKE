Supersingular Isogeny Diffie Hellman :
*Supersingular isogeny Diffie–Hellman key exchange (SIDH) is a post-quantum cryptographic algorithm used to establish a secret key between two parties over an otherwise insecure communications channel. It is analogous to the Diffie–Hellman key exchange, but is based on walks in a supersingular isogeny graph and is designed to resist cryptanalytic attack by an adversary in possession of a quantum computer*  ***(Wikipedia)***
